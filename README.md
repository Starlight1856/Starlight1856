- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @Starlight1856. I began this series of projects at the beginning
of the the year (2021) as a distraction from 'global events'. Each project
is still a ongoing, for example I may combine the TFT work with the telescope
controller to produce a touch-screen controlled 'goto' telescope control.I enjoy
innovation, using what is immediatelly available as much as possible rather than
buying everthing new.

âœ¨ Still thinking of new projects.
